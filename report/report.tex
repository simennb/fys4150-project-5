\subsection{Introduction}
In this project we will attempt to develop code that can be used for gravitational $N$-body simulations. Taking inspiration from an article by M. Joyce and co-workers \red{cite}, we will build a simple model of an open galactic cluster.
\\\\
An open cluster is a group consisting of up to a few thousand gravitationally bound stars, created from the collapse of a molecular cloud, and are usually found in the arms of spiral galaxies or in in irregular galaxies. The collapse of the cloud leads to a burst of star formation. As the stars of the cluster are of similar age and chemical composition, they are very import objects in the study of stellar evolution. Once formed, they gradually dissipate as members are ejected due to random interactions with other clusters, clouds of gas, or internal collisions.
\\\\
First, we look at some of the physics behind our model, making sure to find ideal units to fit our timescale. Running our model for $N = 100$ particles, we check the stability of our system, and find an ideal smoothing function for the gravitational force to remove some of the numerical instabilities. Having done that, we check how long the system takes to stabilize, conservation of energy, and checking the fraction of particles ejected from the system. Looking at only the bound particles, we can check if our results are consistent with the virial theorem.
\red{write motivation for why N body simulations}
\\\\
Finally, we increase the number of particles while keeping the total mass constant, to see how the radial density looks like. This can then be compared to well known profiles such as the Navarro-Frenk-White profile.

\subsection{Theory}

\subsubsection{N-body simulation}
In order to make our model of an open cluster, we will first look at some of the assumptions we make.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Consists of $N$ separate particles only interacting with each other via the Newtonian gravitational force. The force between two particles are then
    \begin{align*}
      F_G = -\frac{G M_1, M_2}{r^2}\numberthis\label{eq:newton}
    \end{align*}
    where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $r$ is the distance between the particles, and $M_1$, $M_2$ is the mass of the particles. For most of the project, we will be looking at $N=100$ particles.
  \item Since the only interaction is the gravitational force, the system is collisionless. If the probability of interactions between particles is low, then collisions have no significant effect on the results. For very large $N$, this might not hold as well.
  \item The particles start with little or no initial velocity, so-called \textit{cold collapse}.
  \item The particles are uniformly distributed within a sphere of radius $R_0 = 20$ ly. Masses are randomly distributed by a Gaussian distribution around $10\,M_{\odot}$ with a deviation of one solar mass.
\end{itemize}
Earlier this fall, we made a model of our solar system. \red{cite report 3} We recall that for a system only affected by Newtonian gravity, Newton's second law of motion gives us the following differential equations for particle $i$
\begin{align*}
  \frac{d^2\mathbf{r_i}}{dt^2} &= \sum\limits_{j\neq i}\frac{F_G(\mathbf{r}_{ij}, M_i,M_j)}{M_i}\numberthis\label{eq:diff_eq}
\end{align*}
where $\mathbf{r}$ is a three-dimensional vector in $(x,y,z)$, and we sum over the gravitational contribution of the other particles. We note that the length and timescale should be adjusted to units more fit for the dynamics of the system.\\\\
For the length scale, we can use lightyears, as the particles are initially uniformly distributed inside a sphere of radius $R_0 = 20$ ly. In order to find units of time that fit the timescale however, we will take a short detour into non-linear perturbation theory and cosmology.

\subsubsection{The spherical top-hat model}
While solving non-linear perturbation theory analytically can be difficult (or impossible), there does exists an analytical solution for the so-called ``\textit{spherical top-hat}'' model \red{cite cosmo notes}. In this model, we look at a spherical perturbation of radius $R$, with a uniform density inside. It can be shown that this model has a parametrised solution
\begin{align*}
  R &= A(1-\cos\theta)\numberthis\label{eq:top-hat}\\
  t &= B(\theta-\sin\theta)\\
  &A^3 = GMB^2 
\end{align*}
From equation \eqref{eq:top-hat}, we see that the sphere reaches a maximum at $\theta = \pi$, at time $t=\pi B$ (also referred to as turn-around). The sphere collapses completely at $\theta = 2\pi$, at time $t = 2\pi B$. At $\theta = \tfrac{3\pi}{2}$, the model virializes at radius $1/2 R_0$. For the peak radius
\begin{align*}
  R(\theta = \pi) &= 2A = R_0\\
  t(\theta = \pi) &= \pi B
\end{align*}
Solving for $B$
\begin{align*}
  B &= \frac{A^{3/2}}{\sqrt{GM}}
  \intertext{Using that the density of the perturbation is given by $\rho_0 = M/V = M/(4/3\pi R_0^3)$}
  B &= \frac{(R_0/2)^{3/2}}{\sqrt{G\frac{4\pi R_0^3\rho_0}{3}}}\\
  B &= \sqrt{\frac{3}{32\pi G\rho_0}}
\end{align*}
Since our simulation starts with cold collapse (at turn-around $\theta = \pi$), the time it takes to collapse is
\begin{align*}
  t_{\text{coll}} &= t_{2\pi} - t_{\pi}\\
  t_{\text{coll}} &= 2\pi B - \pi B = \pi B
  \intertext{inserting the expression we found for $B$, we get the collapse time}
  t_{\text{coll}} &= \sqrt{\frac{3\pi}{32G\rho_0}}\numberthis\label{eq:t_coll}
\end{align*}
As this time, $t_{\text{coll}}$ is an analytical expression for collapse in the \textit{spherical top-hat model}, this is a much more fitting timescale to probe our system with compared to seconds or years.\\\\
In order to make use of this, we need to scale equation \eqref{eq:newton} in these units, specifically $G$. Rewriting equation \eqref{eq:t_coll} gives us
\begin{align*}
  G &= \frac{3\pi}{32\rho_0t_{\text{coll}}^2}
  \intertext{Scaling so that we are looking at timescales of order $t_{\text{coll}}$, and inserting $\rho_0 = 4/3\pi R_0^3$}
  G &= \frac{\pi^2R_0^3}{8M_{tot}} = \frac{\pi^2R_0^3}{8N\mu} \numberthis\label{eq:G}
\end{align*}
where $N$ is the number of particles, and $\mu$ is the average mass (in solar masses) per particle.\\\\
Inserting equation \eqref{eq:G} into the differential equation given by \eqref{eq:diff_eq} gives us the units $[\text{ly}/t_{\text{coll}}]$, which is what we wanted.

\subsubsection{Numerical instabilities}
Since we will be solving the system numerically, we have to be aware of some of the problems of doing so. In this project, we will focus on the numerical instability that arises when two particles come very close to each other. When two particles get close to each other, the accelerations get large, and unless we have very small timesteps, the trajectory of a particle is not calculated accurately. To deal with this, we will introduce a very simple smoothing function by modifying the Newtonian force \eqref{eq:newton}
\begin{align*}
  F_{\text{mod}} &= \frac{GM_1M_2}{r^2 + \varepsilon^2} \numberthis\label{eq:newton_mod}
\end{align*}
where $\varepsilon$ is a small real constant that causes equation \eqref{eq:newton_mod} to be finite on short length scales. While adding this smoothing factor smooths out the instabilities, it also means that on length scales smaller than $\varepsilon$, the trajectories are not integrated accurately. This means that we should make sure to set the smoothing factor $\varepsilon$ to a length so that 1) instabilities are smoothed out, and 2) the inaccuracy in the trajectory does not play a significant part of the macroscopic evolution of the system.\\\\
As we discussed earlier, we assume the system to be collisionless, and that collisions (or close encounters) should not affect the system much. Since our particles does not represent point particles, but mass distributions with some finite radius, a really close encounter between two particles might not be fully collisionless. The smoothing factor does then in a sense represent the fact that our system is not fully collisionless, but the magnitude of it is most likely considerably larger than the scale at which collisions become relevant.\\\\
Finding an ideal size for $\varepsilon$ can be difficult. A simple way to evaluate this is to first find the mean interparticle distance. \red{cite Joyce full}
\begin{align*}
  l &\equiv \bigg(\frac{3V}{4\pi N}\bigg)^{1/3} = \frac{R_0}{N^{1/3}} \numberthis\label{eq:mean_dist}
\end{align*}
where $R_0$ is the initial radius of the sphere, and $N$ is the number of particles. Since this is the average distance between the particles at the start of the simulation, we should make sure that our choice of $\varepsilon$ is significantly less than $l$, as it limits how small the structure is allowed to collapse. For example, for the situation $R_0 = 20$ and $N = 100$, we have $l \approx 4.3$.

\subsubsection{Particle ejection}
Due to looking at a \textit{cold collapse}, all particles start with a negative energy, but as the system evolves, some of the particles can end up with a positive energy, and completely escape from the system. We can therefore identify these ejected particles by comparing the per particle kinetic and potential energy, and identifying which particles have a total energy greater than zero
\begin{align*}
  E_{i,\text{tot}} = K_i + V_i > 0 \numberthis\label{eq:ejection}
\end{align*}
where $K_i$ and $V_i$ is the kinetic and potential energy for particle $i$.\\\\
The energy taken away from the system by particle ejection can be found by energy conservation and that once the system stabilizes, the potential energy of the ejected particles and the interaction between bound and ejected particles is negligible
\begin{align*}
  E_0 &= V_b + K_b + K_f \numberthis\label{eq:energy_ejection}
\end{align*}
where $E_0$ is the initial energy of the system, $V_b$ and $K_b$ is the kinetic and potential energy of the particles that are gravitationally bound, and $K_f$ is the kinetic energy of the ejected particles.
$K_f$ can be found as discussed earlier in equation \eqref{eq:ejection}.

\subsubsection{Virial theorem}
For a bound gravitational system in equilibrium, the virial theorem says that
\begin{align*}
  2\langle K\rangle &= -\langle V\rangle \numberthis\label{eq:virial}
\end{align*}
where $\langle K\rangle$ is the time-average kinetic energy of the system, and $\langle V\rangle$ is the time-average potential energy. By the ergodic hypothesis, we can assume that an average over a large enough system should give the same result as the time average. Thus we have
\begin{align*}
  2K_b &= -V_b \numberthis\label{eq:virial2}
\end{align*}
where $K_b$ and $V_b$ are the energies for the bound particles, and can be found from equation \eqref{eq:energy_ejection}

\subsubsection{Radial density of particles}
For an approximately spherical symmetric collapsed halo (virialized structure), the radial density profile can often be fit very well with the simple expression
\begin{align*}
  n(r) = \frac{n_0}{\Big(1+(\frac{r}{r_0})^4\Big)} \numberthis\label{eq:radial_dist}
\end{align*}
where $n_0$ and the scale radius $r_0$ has some dependency on the number of particles $N$.\\\\
The well-known Navarro-Frenk-White profile can also be used to compare with results.
\begin{align*}
  \rho(r) &= \frac{\rho_0}{\frac{r}{r_0}\Big(1+\frac{r}{r_0}\Big)^2}\numberthis\label{eq:NFW}
\end{align*}
where $\rho_0$ and $r_0$ depends on $N$ in some way.
\subsubsection{Numerical solving}
In order to solve the system numerically, we will employ the Velocity Verlet method. A full derivation of the Velocity Verlet method can be found in \red{cite project 3}, where the following algorithm is also found.
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\small
\caption{Velocity Verlet}\label{alg:VelVerlet}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\For{$i = 0, n$}
\State $r_{i+1} = r_i + v_i h + \frac{1}{2} a_i h^2$
\State $a_{i+1} = F_{G, r_{i+1}}/m$
\State $v_{i+1} = v_i + \frac{1}{2} h (a_i + a_{i+1})$
\EndFor
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
\subsection{Experimental}
The programs used in this project can be found in the GitHub repository \cite{GitHub}, in the \texttt{/src/} folder. When running the program it takes 4 command line arguments: \texttt{N}, \texttt{t\_coll}, \texttt{dt} and \texttt{eps}. \texttt{N} is the number of stars in our cluster, \texttt{t\_coll} is our time unit, based on the collision time, \texttt{dt} is the time step and \texttt{eps} is the smoothing factor used in the force calculation. All data written to file by the main program are stored in \texttt{/benchmarks/} where most of the data analysis were done by python programs stored in \texttt{/python/} and the figures and gifs can be found in \texttt{/figures/}. \\ \\
The simulation starts by randomly positioning different stars inside a sphere with radius R = 20 light years. Each star will have an individual mass where the total mass is forced to be 1000 solar masses and an initial velocity set to be 0 in all directions. \\
Once all the positions and masses have been set, we can find the forces acting between them. While using velocity verlet to simulate the behaviour we can also find the individual kinetic and potential energy of each star as well as the total kinetic and potential energy of the system.

Choice of time step was done by trial and error. From the extended report \husk{cite Joyce full} we found that they had used a time step of 1.0e-05, but had a smaller radius. We tried different values and found that 1.0e-03 was a good time step which both gave us a good resolution while also keeping the time usage of the program low. \\ \\
In the limit $N \rightarrow \, \infty$ with a constant $\rho$ we get a continuous fluid. The system should then collapse into a singularity after one $t_{coll}$. However, we do not observe this collapse in our simulation. This is because we neglect collisions and our particles are not uniformly distributed. With random distribution there will be many particles that do not go through the center, and even if they did there would be nothing there to stop it as it can not collide.

As we can see from figure \ref{fig:noeps} the energy is never conserved nor is it stable and there is no point in discussing these plots in detail. The plots in figure \ref{fig:witheps} however are much more interesting and we are especially interested in the middle and bottom ones for each simulation. Number of particles escaping and the kinetic energy of these particles are found using equation \eqref{eq:ejection} and we notice two trends. As the number of particles increases there seem to be a larger fraction of escaping particles. This is true up until 500 particles, but the fraction is a bit lower at 1000. The cause of this might either be that there are abnormalities in our measurements, this could easily be corrected by doing the siumulation many times and the take an average, or it could be because the fraction increases for low values of N and then it is more constant for larger values of N. By looking at the energy of the escaped particles we see a different story. Max values of each simulation at the equilibrium time (see below) seem to decrease as there are more particles added to the system. This means that with more particles, even though more are escaping, the once that do escape has a lower kinetic energy per particle. \\
Once the system reaches equilibrium there are still some particles being ejected, as seen from the fraction of particles escaping, but this fraction becomes more and more stable for larger values of N. \\
The system seems in general to be more stable for larger values of N. If we were to do this experiment again we would likely use larger N-values and do multiple simulations for each N-value. This time around however, we had exams in a lot of other courses and had only time for the simulations we have run.

One of the assumptions we have made is that we don't have any collisions between the particles. To correct for this the smoothing factor was implemented to our force calculations as shown in \eqref{eq:newton_mod}. The ideal value for the smoothing factor is a factor that is difficult to pinpoint. However, we would like it to be a couple of factors lower than the mean interparticle distance given by equation \eqref{eq:mean_dist}. As we can see from the figures in \ref{fig:noeps} there were several values tried out for N = 200 which would have a mean interparticle distance of 3.42 light years. The value $\epsilon = $ 0.02 was clearly the worst. With no stabilization in the escaped particles and a total energy showing a increase rather than being stable, the value could not be used. $\epsilon = 0.2$ and $\epsilon = 2.0$ both show a stabilizing effect. The oscillation of the fraction of high energy particles for $\epsilon = 0.2$ could be a result of particles on the borderline of escaping, going back and fort. If we did this project again I would like to do this for even more values of N, finding a better way to determine $\epsilon$ and find the reason for the oscillating. \\
With a knwon vaue of $\epsilon$ for 200 N we redid the results from earlier tasks. The challange here was to estimate a value of $\epsilon$ for every N. As we only knew it should become smaller with larger N and that for 0.2 was good for 200, we set the value to 0.1 before simulating 100, 200, 500 and 1000 particles. Ideally every values of N should have its own $\epsilon$, but since we only know that it should be less than the mean interparticle distance and 0.2 worked for 200, we thought that 0.1 would be a good estimation for all these N-values, even though it is probably better for larger values of N. If we were to do this project again, it would be wise to find individual $\epsilon$ by comparing different values as in figure \ref{fig:noeps}, but as our results are not used any further, our estimation seems to be a good one. \\
These figures shows us that with a smoothing factor we can reach an equilibrium which differs in time for the different values of N that are placed randomly within the same volume and with the same total mass. By looking at the fraction of particles with positive energy, there seems to be an equilibrium at around 1 $t_{coll}$ for 100 particles, 1.6 $t_{coll}$ for 200, 2.5 $t_{coll}$ for 500 and 3.5 $t_{coll}$ for 1000 particles. This increase in equilibrium time is a bit weird as one would expect the equilibrium time to go to one as we increase the number of particles. The fact that we observe the oposite shows us that something is wrong, but we have not been able to see what. Once again we realize that if we were to do this again, the increasing equilibrium time is definetly something we should correct.\\
The bottom part of the three plots for each N-values shows us the energy of the escaped particles. We notice that once equilibrium is reached there is a "smooth" decrease in kinetic energy which goes as a function of 1 over something squared. This something is probably the distance $r$ which tells us that once the particles have escaped they will have a decrease in kinetic energy inversly proportional with distance squared. \\ \\
The addition of the smoothing factor can be justified to some extent, as discussed in the theory, by the fact that we do not look at point particles and we do not simulate collisions between the particles. This will not give a perfect simulation, but for our purposes in this project the corrections are a good estimation. \\ \\

From figure \ref{fig:viral} the viral theorem fits better and better for higher values of N. This makes sense as a larger N will bring us closer to the expectation value of kinetic and potential energy. The difference from zero is however to large to ignore, at least for N = 100. This means that the viral theorem is almost true in our system, but not quite and especially not for a small number particles. It should be true once the system is in equilibrium and we can't find the reason why. It might be the way we extract the energy for bound particles, it might be that we have a fault in our simulation or it might be that the smoothing factor is not ideal. If we were to do the experiment again we would look into more into this and see if we could improve the viral theorem. But as the other parts of our program makes sense and our viral theorem test improves for larger values of N, it is reasonable to argue that we have something that works, but it is not ideal for small N or that our energy is either extracted wrong or manipulated wrong by our calculations.

As we can see from figure \ref{fig:radialDens} the cluster is densest near origo. This is as expected
